Quick housekeeping before we dive in:
First, throughout this training, I'll be answering questions live. If you have a question, drop it in the Q&A box (not the chat), and I'll get to as many as I can.
Second, you're going to want to take notes. What I'm about to share with you has taken me years to learn, and I'm going to pack it all into the next 90 minutes.
And third, stick around until the end because I have something special for everyone who stays. It's going to be worth your time, I promise.
Alright, we've got a great group here. We're going to start in just 2 more minutes. Get your notebooks ready!
