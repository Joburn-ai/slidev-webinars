<!--
This mechanism matters because generic study advice fails catastrophically when applied to AP exams. Telling your teen to 'write a good essay' is like telling them to 'drive safely' without teaching them the specific rules of the road—it's not actionable, and it leads to crashes. Good intentions without proper frameworks create failure.

While political sovereignty marked an absolute break with British authority, economic and cultural ties demonstrated significant continuity in the decades following 1783."
