# The Truth

- Classroom grades ≠ AP exam scores

</div>

<!--
Classroom grades and AP exam scores operate on completely different systems. Your straight-A student could easily score a 2 or 3 because AP teachers focus on content mastery, while AP graders use specific scoring frameworks that most teachers never see.
